## Getting Started Kubernetes Ingress Gateway

Getting started is extremely simple and can be achieved in less than a minute. Once the helm repositories are setup, all it takes a simple command to set it up.

## Getting Started Docker Gateway

EnRoute is the only gateway on Envoy proxy that works for both Kubernetes Ingress and Standalone use-cases. Typically solutions either target one or the other. A majority of users have a mix of workloads, and this capability comes in handy, especially with the same consistent policy model across all deployments. And running Envoy makes it a super performant solution.

[Getting Started EnRoute Standalone Guide](https://getenroute.io/reference/getting-started/getting-started-enroute-standalone-gateway/)

* EnRoute Standalone can also be setup using the [getting started bash script](https://github.com/saarasio/gettingstarted)

* EnRoute APIs can be invoked from any language. [An example in golang can be found here](https://github.com/saarasio/api-ratelimit)

* Use ```enroutectl``` to [program OpenAPI spec on gateway](https://getenroute.io/cookbook/openapi-swagger-spec-autoprogram-api-gateway-30-seconds-no-code/)
