# awsSettings controls AWS annotations
# This annotation puts the AWS ELB into "TCP" mode so that it does not
# do HTTP negotiation for HTTPS connections at the ELB edge.
# The downside of this is the remote IP address of all connections will
# appear to be the internal address of the ELB. See docs/proxy-proto.md
# for information about enabling the PROXY protocol on the ELB to recover
# the original remote IP address.
